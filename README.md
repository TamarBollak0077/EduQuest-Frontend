## 🧩 Overview

**GroupCards** is an interactive educational card game designed for **elementary school students**.  
Three teams compete to **color as many cards as possible** by completing real-world challenges and making smart choices.  
The team with the most colored cards wins!

> 🧱 This repository includes the **Frontend MVP**, built as part of a paid educational project for a school client.

## 🃏 Game Flow

1. The main screen displays a **grid of 30 cards**.  
2. A **colored dice** randomly selects which team plays next (3 colors = 3 teams).  
3. The selected team chooses a card; the game operator clicks it.  
4. Each card type triggers a different outcome:

| 🪄 Card Type | 🧠 Description | 🏁 Result |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Task Card** | “You got a mission!” – external challenge | If successful → card turns team color |
| **Bonus Card** | “You earned another turn!” | Card turns color + team continues |
| **Loss Card** | “You lost your turn!” | No color change, turn ends |

5. When all cards are colored → the system announces the **winning team**.
